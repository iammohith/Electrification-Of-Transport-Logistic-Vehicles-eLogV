# Electrification Of Transport Logistic Vehicles (eLogV)

## Abstarct

In the United States, the trucking industry accounts for approximately 23% of total greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to 1.475 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. In India, road transport contributes nearly 90% of greenhouse gas emissions, with trucking and logistics vehicles responsible for over 25% of that total. Transitioning this sector to renewable energy sources would represent a significant advancement in our efforts to combat climate change.

However, this transition is not as simple as retrofitting trucks with batteries and electric motors, as exemplified by Elon Musk's approach with the Tesla Semi Truck. Several technical challenges must be addressed first. The most pressing issue is the energy density of batteries, which refers to the amount of energy delivered per kilogram of battery weight.

Additionally, the development of specialized charging infrastructure designed specifically for trucks is essential. An efficient battery management system is necessary to minimize damage and maximize the lifespan of the trucks. Furthermore, improving the aerodynamic design of trucks will enhance power efficiency. It is also crucial to utilize high-capacity motors to ensure smooth transmission and performance.

This report discusses and presents the various challenges and potential solutions for transitioning the trucking industry to renewable energy sources, emphasizing the need for innovative technologies to overcome these obstacles.
