# Electrification Of Transport Logistic Vehicles (eLogV)

## Abstarct

In the United States, the trucking industry accounts for approximately 23% of total greenhouse gas emissions, equivalent to 1.475 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. In India, road transport contributes nearly 90% of greenhouse gas emissions, with trucking and logistics vehicles responsible for over 25% of that total. Transitioning this sector to renewable energy sources would represent a significant advancement in our efforts to combat climate change.

However, this transition is not as simple as retrofitting trucks with batteries and electric motors, as exemplified by Elon Musk's approach with the Tesla Semi Truck. Several technical challenges must be addressed first. The most pressing issue is the energy density of batteries, which refers to the amount of energy delivered per kilogram of battery weight.

Additionally, the development of specialized charging infrastructure designed specifically for trucks is essential. An efficient battery management system is necessary to minimize damage and maximize the lifespan of the trucks. Furthermore, improving the aerodynamic design of trucks will enhance power efficiency. It is also crucial to utilize high-capacity motors to ensure smooth transmission and performance.

This report discusses and presents the various challenges and potential solutions for transitioning the trucking industry to renewable energy sources, emphasizing the need for innovative technologies to overcome these obstacles.

## Conclusion

After analyzing the results, it is clear that producing an affordable electric vehicle (EV) truck using current technologies and battery energy densities presents significant challenges. The cost of batteries alone is prohibitive. For instance, with a Lithium-Ion battery and no road gradient, the cost is approximately $269,617.29. When factoring in a road gradient of 0.25 for 15% of the journey, the cost rises to $1,279,497.86. Similarly, using a solid-state battery without a road gradient results in a cost of $354,759.59, but with the same road gradient, the cost escalates to $1,683,549.82.

Even with such substantial investments in battery technology, achieving the ideal balance between vehicle weight and battery capacity remains elusive, especially when road gradients increase. For solid-state batteries in particular, the issue of weight savings becomes more critical, leaving significantly less capacity to accommodate additional loads. At these price points, it becomes nearly impossible to achieve a break-even point in terms of return on investment (ROI).

In theory, solutions such as integrating solar panels and triboelectric nanogenerators may alleviate some of these challenges. However, these technologies would also drive up the overall cost, complicating the affordability of EV trucks. Therefore, relying solely on theoretical values is insufficientâ€”physical models must be developed and tested in real-world scenarios to validate these ideas.

Only time will tell if affordable EV trucks can be realized through advancements in technology and battery development. Nevertheless, I hope that my ideas can inspire and assist others in continuing the pursuit of innovative EV truck solutions. Let us remain hopeful that affordable EV trucks will soon become a reality with the help of the latest technologies and battery innovations.
